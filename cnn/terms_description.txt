cellXCount = number of cell horizontally
cellYCount = number of cell vertically
cellX = width of each cell
cellY = height of each cell


Open buildings 2D:
1. Download buildings data.
2. Run preprocessing file on that. (takes around 1 hour)
    It will create a single scene based on that buildings data and write the scene on a file.
    Format:
    a scene_id polygon_id vertex_id x y
    .....
    b scene_minX scene_maxX scene_minY scene_maxY
    Example:
    Say a scene has one only triangle. Then the written file will be kind of -
    a 0 0 0 5 6
    a 0 0 1 3 4
    a 0 0 2 2 3
    b 0 10 0 10
3. Run gen_scene on any scene file to create sub scene based on some logic. I have implemented only random sampling. You should add deterministic grid by grid sampling. (can take a long time to execute based on what you want)
4. Run select_scene on any scene file to only select scene based on area coverage.
5. Run polygon_gen on any scene file to generate query data points.

**6**. There is a visualization file. It takes any scene file and visualizes it.
        + ---> zooms in
        - ----> zooms out
        mouse left drag ---> moves the scene
        ....
        Actually it has a lot of control. You should check the code to find about them.


Bugs:
1. There is a bug when creating embedding for polygon. It is a special case. I haven't fixed it. You should try to.
